## Power analysis performed for Multilevel CFA models

This folder includes the eproducible R code&sup1; and generated **[full report](https://Luca-Menghini.github.io/ESMscales-workplaceStress/S1_PowerAnalysis/S1_powerAnalysis_fullReport.html)** of the a priori power analysis of the multilevel confirmatory factor analysis used to evaluate the factor structure of the three scales. A more synthetic PDF report is [available at this link](https://Luca-Menghini.github.io/ESMscales-workplaceStress/S1_PowerAnalysis/S1_powerAnalysis_shortReport.pdf).

### Notes

1. The chunks of R code in the first part of the Rmd script are set with `eval = FALSE` to save computational time while generating the report. To reproduce the full report, set `eval = TRUE` or contact the first author to obtain the `TDS_PARAMETERS.RData`, `TCS_PARAMETERS.RData`, and `MDMQ_PARAMETERS.RData` files (too large to be shared here).
