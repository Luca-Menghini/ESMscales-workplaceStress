## Power analysis performed for Multilevel CFA models

This folder includes the R code&sup1; and generated **[full report](https://Luca-Menghini.github.io/ESMscales-workplaceStress/S1_PowerAnalysis/S1_powerAnalysis_fullReport.html)** of the a priori power analysis of the multilevel confirmatory factor analysis (MCFA) used to evaluate the factor structure of the three ESM scales. A more synthetic PDF report can be visualized **[at this link](https://Luca-Menghini.github.io/ESMscales-workplaceStress/S1_PowerAnalysis/S1_powerAnalysis_shortReport.pdf)**.

### Notes

1. the first part of the `S1_powerAnalysis_code.Rmd` generates three datasets (`TDS_PARAMETERS.RData`, `TCS_PARAMETERS.RData`, and `MDMQ_PARAMETERS.RData`) necessary to execute the commands of the second part, which were too large to be shared but can be generated with the first part of the script (otherwise obtained upon request to the first author).
